Hi everyone,

This account is <u>permanently banned</u> due to breaking GitHub's rules against sharing illegal content related to hack and security, like ransomware, malware, keyloggers, and viruses. Sadly, despite our efforts to restore some of the useful content, everything posted by this account, including source codes, has been taken down by GitHub's support team.

Because of this permanent ban and our inability to keep operating on platforms like Telegram, GitHub, YouTube, and Rubika, the <u>Black Source cyber security team is shutting down all educational activities</u>. However, our collaborative projects and freelancing services will continue privately. If you need to check out more of our work or want to place an order related to programming or cybersecurity, you can reach out through the contact info on our GitHub account [Brav0S1X](https://github.com/Brav0S1X).

<b>We apologize for sharing any illegal content and hope you can help us identify any sources that might be distributing our old materials without permission.</b>

Stay safe in the cyber world :)<br>
<i>[BlackSource] cybeR sEcurity Development TEAM</i>
